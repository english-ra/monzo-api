# Monzo API Project

### Problem
I really like Monzo for the amount of automation you can do out of the box, directly within the app but there is a slight issue I have come across. I get paid on the last Friday of the month and there is no option to automatically move money to pots based on this criteria. This mean that it leaves me with the option to set it for the 1st of the month but this means that there can sometimes be up to a week where the money stays in my main account balance.

### Solution
I have created an automation mini app that runs on the last Friday of the month and automatically sorts my money into the respective pots. This also supports Monzo's Joint account.

### Sharing and Usage
Please feel free to use this as a baseline and expand upon for anything that works for you.
